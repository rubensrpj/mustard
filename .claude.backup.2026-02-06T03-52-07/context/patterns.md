# Patterns & Conventions

## Backend Patterns (Node.js unknown)

### Module Structure
- Controllers/routes handle HTTP concerns
- Services contain business logic
- Repositories handle data access (if applicable)

### Dependency Injection
- Constructor injection or module-level imports

> Add service-example.md and endpoint-example.md to context/ for reference patterns.




## General Principles

- Separate business logic from data access
- Validate at system boundaries (endpoints, forms)
- Use consistent error response shapes
- Follow established naming conventions (see naming.md)


## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Business logic in controllers/endpoints
- Data access outside the data layer
- Duplicated validation logic
- Hardcoded values instead of constants/enums
