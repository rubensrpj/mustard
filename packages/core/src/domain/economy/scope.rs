//! Scope selector for economy queries.
//!
//! [`EconomyScope`] is the single input every reader function in
//! [`economy::reader`](super::reader) takes. It expresses *which slice* of the
//! cost universe a caller is asking about — a single project's totals, a
//! single spec's slice of that project, a single wave within that spec, or a
//! union across several projects on disk.
//!
//! Keeping the scope as a first-class enum (instead of `Option<String>` triples
//! threaded through every signature) lets the writer/reader layer pattern-match
//! once and dispatch to the right SQL or to
//! [`multi_project::MultiProjectReader`](super::multi_project::MultiProjectReader),
//! and lets future variants (e.g. `TimeWindow`) extend the API without breaking
//! callers — the enum is `#[non_exhaustive]`.
//!
//! The newtypes below ([`ProjectPath`], [`SpecId`], [`WaveId`], [`AgentId`])
//! exist for the same reason: stronger types at the API boundary prevent
//! accidental swaps (a spec id passed where a wave id was expected compiles to
//! a different error today than it did against three `String` parameters).
