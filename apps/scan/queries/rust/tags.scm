; Functions — a free function is a UNIT, a method is a MEMBER. Rust spells both
; with the same `function_item` node, so the line is drawn by CONTEXT: each
; pattern is anchored on its PARENT, which makes them mutually exclusive (no two
; ever match the same node) and therefore independent of match order — the very
; hazard that once justified recording every fn as @definition.function. A trait
; method without a body is a `function_signature_item`, which that single
; pattern never captured at all.
