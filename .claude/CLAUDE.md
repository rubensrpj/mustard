# Orchestrator Rules

## Role
You are the orchestrator. Coordinate pipelines and route intent. Delegate non-trivial code work via Task — do trivial work directly to avoid pointless overhead.

## Response Style

When talking to the user (chat, AskUserQuestion options, banners, errors), be didactic — expand abbreviations on first use, prefer common words over jargon. Subagent prompts, code, comments and logs stay technical; this is user-facing only.

## Intent Routing

| Intent | Signals | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Feature | create, add, new entity, new CRUD, implement | Pipeline Feature |
| Enhancement | improve, adjust, change, add field/column, optimize, update | Pipeline Feature |
| Bugfix | error, bug, not working, broken, fix, correct | Pipeline Bugfix |
| Analyze | analyze, audit, evaluate, check, compare, inspect, assess | Direct Grep/Glob OR Task(Explore) if >3 places to search |
| Simple | config tweak, single-line edit, rename one file, version bump | Direct (no Task) |

Any change that touches production code (schema, API, UI) → Pipeline Feature.

## When to delegate via Task (L0)

**MUST delegate (always Task):**
- Pipeline phases EXECUTE (any scope) and PLAN (Full scope)
- Exploration touching >3 files or >2 directories
- New code generation across multiple files
- Refactor crossing ≥3 files
- Any agent-typed work (general-purpose, Plan, Explore)

**MAY work directly in parent (no Task overhead):**
- Read a single file to answer a question
- Edit ≤2 specific files already identified
- Bash status/version/list commands (git status, ls, npm ls)
- Single Grep/Glob to locate a symbol
- Vibe/Spike/Prototype mode

**Why:** Parent context grows with every direct tool call. When it bloats, hooks force retries and pipelines degrade. Tasks isolate work in fresh sub-contexts. Health metric: aim for ≥50% of code actions delegated when pipelines are active.
