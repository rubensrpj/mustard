# /bugfix - Bug Fix Pipeline

> ALWAYS before making any change. Search on the web for the newest documentation and only implement if you are 100% sure it will work.

## Trigger

`/bugfix <error-description>`

## Description

Autonomous pipeline to diagnose and fix bugs. Zero context-switch — never ask the user what can be discovered autonomously.

## Procedure

### Spec Hygiene (automatic, before ANALYZE)

Before starting a new pipeline, audit specs in `.claude/spec/`:

1. **Scan** all specs in `.claude/spec/*/spec.md`
2. **For each spec**, read the full header and checklist to extract `Stage:`, `Outcome:`, `Phase:`, and checkbox completion (`[x]` vs `[ ]`). Filter by `Stage:` + `Outcome:` (and/or SQLite `pipeline_state_for_spec`) — specs already `Outcome: Completed` are skipped.
3. **Verify completed/cancelled specs:**
   - If `Outcome: Completed` or `Outcome: Abandoned`:
     - **Analyze first**: check that ALL checklist items are `[x]`, no `## Concerns` with unresolved `BLOCKED` items, and build/type-check references are satisfied
     - If analysis confirms done → flip status via `mustard-rt run complete-spec {name} --archive`, delete the `.diff.md` if it exists (pipeline phase is derived from `pipeline.phase` events in SQLite — there is no JSON state file to delete; no filesystem move happens, the spec dir stays at `.claude/spec/{name}/`), log: `[HYGIENE] Verified and archived {name}`
     - If analysis finds incomplete items → update `### Stage: Execute` + `### Outcome: Active`, log: `[HYGIENE] {name} marked completed but has {N} unchecked items — reverted to implementing`, then treat as in-progress (step 4)
4. **In-progress specs** (`Stage: Plan` or `Stage: Execute` with `Outcome: Active`):
   - Use `AskUserQuestion`: _"Found spec in progress: **{name}** (Stage: {stage}, Outcome: {outcome}, Phase: {phase}, {done}/{total} tasks done). Do you want to continue this spec before starting a new one?"_
   - If **yes** → stop, suggest `/resume` to continue the existing spec
   - If **no** → proceed to ANALYZE for the new pipeline (existing spec stays in `.claude/spec/{name}/`)
5. **No active specs** → proceed to ANALYZE normally

This step is silent when there's nothing to audit — no output if no active specs are found.

### ANALYZE (diagnose + assess)

**Phase marker (first action, before any Grep):** Run `mustard-rt run emit-phase --spec {spec-name} --to ANALYZE`. ANALYZE runs in the parent before any pipeline-state file exists, so `pipeline-phase.js` cannot see it — this is the only point that knows ANALYZE started. Idempotent (script skips if already emitted for this spec) and fail-open.

1. **AUTO-SYNC:** Run `mustard-rt run sync-detect`. If output shows any subproject with `hashChanged: true`, then run `mustard-rt run sync-registry`. Otherwise skip sync-registry entirely.

### Diff Context (automatic)

**Diff snapshot (run once per phase):**
Run `mustard-rt run diff-context` at the start of EXECUTE only. ANALYZE skipped (diff always empty pre-work) — emits `analyze-diff-skip` metric. Save the output to `.claude/.pipeline-states/{specName}.diff.md` (overwrite each phase).

**Inject into every Task dispatch in this pipeline:**
Prepend the following to EVERY subagent prompt dispatched during the pipeline:

```
## Current Git State
{contents of .claude/.pipeline-states/{specName}.diff.md}

## Your Task
...original prompt...
```

If the diff file is empty or missing, skip the Git State header entirely. Never dispatch an agent without attempting interpolation.

2. **DIAGNOSE:** Dispatch Explore agent (**≤20 tool uses, ≤3 full file reads**) with `diagnose` skill (explicit exception: diagnostic loop is the method of a bug-Explore agent):
   - Scoped Grep searches with specific path + pattern for the error/symptom
   - Trace callers/callees via Grep in relevant directories (prefer Grep over Read)
   - Return as soon as root cause is clear — don't exhaustively scan
   - Return: root cause file(s), line(s), explanation

2b. **Cache root-cause for retry reuse:**

After DIAGNOSE returns, compute a cache signature so fix-loop retries can skip re-DIAGNOSE when the affected surface hasn't changed:

```javascript
// in-memory during bugfix session (also persisted to pipeline-state for Full Path)
const affectedFiles = [...root-cause file(s) from Explore return, sorted];
const bugDescription = {user's error description, canonical — trimmed and lowercased};
const rootCauseHash = sha256(bugDescription + '|' + affectedFiles.join(','));
const rootCauseSummary = {1-line root cause from Explore, ≤500 chars};
const affectedFilesHash = sha256(concatenated contents of affectedFiles right now);
```

For Full Path, keep the root-cause cache in-memory during the session (the retry loop runs within the same session). No pipeline-state JSON write is needed — the projection reads status from SQLite events. For Fast Path, the cache is also in-memory only.
3. **ASSESS — Decision point:**
   - Explore returns clear root cause in 1-2 files → **Fast Path** (skip PLAN)
   - 3+ files, unclear impact, cross-layer → **Full Path** (brief spec via PLAN)

**Fast Path:** Go directly to EXECUTE. No spec, no approval gate (Zero Context-Switch Protocol). If you want to review the fix plan before EXECUTE, force Full Path by listing >5 files in the ANALYZE return.
**Full Path:** Write brief spec in `.claude/spec/{date}-{name}/spec.md`.

**Resolve spec language first** (cascade, stop at first hit):
1. existing `### Lang: pt|en` in any spec.md being reused → use it;
2. `.claude/mustard.json#specLang` → use it;
3. otherwise `AskUserQuestion` ÚNICA: `"Spec language: pt | en?"` → persist to `mustard.json#specLang`.

**HARD RULE — Headers consistency:** when `Lang: pt`, **ALL** `## ` body headings MUST be in PT — translate every default: `## Boundaries → ## Limites`, `## Root cause → ## Causa raiz`, `## Plan → ## Plano`, `## Concerns → ## Preocupações`, `## Acceptance Criteria → ## Critérios de Aceitação`. Do NOT mix. When `Lang: en`, keep all EN. Exceptions (always EN): status/phase/scope values, commands, filenames, AC `Command:` field.

**HARD RULE — Source code language:** every file the agent writes or edits stays in English regardless of `Lang`. This covers identifiers, comments in every form (`//`, `#`, `/* */`, `///`, `'''`, `"""`, doc-comments, JSDoc, `<!-- -->`), log/error messages, AC `Command:` content. `Lang` applies to spec narrative only — never to code. Pre-existing comments are NOT translated (surgical changes — karpathy §3).

→ See `../../../refs/feature/spec-language.md` for full Header Translation Table.

**Two-layer structure (lean):** a bugfix spec follows the same two-layer model as a feature spec (`## PRD` = the *what & why*, `## Plano` = the *how* — see `/feature` § Full Scope and `pipeline-config.md` § Spec Artifact). But a bugfix spec is small, so the layers stay **implicit, not bureaucratic**: `## Contexto` + `## Acceptance Criteria` are the PRD layer; `## Causa raiz` + `## Plano` + `## Boundaries` are the Plano layer. Do NOT add `## PRD`/`## Plano` divider headings or PRD subsections (`## Usuários/Stakeholders`, `## Não-Objetivos`) to a bugfix spec — that is the bureaucracy the layering is meant to avoid.

The spec header MUST include `### Lang: {pt|en}`. The spec MUST include (Wave 10):
   ```markdown
   ## Contexto    ← exact heading if Lang=pt — PRD layer (the "what & why")
   (or)
   ## Context     ← exact heading if Lang=en

   {Narrative prose, 4-8 lines. Tell the story:
    - How the system should work (explain domain terms on first use)
    - What broke or what's the expected behavior
    - Observable impact for user or business (NOT for the DB)
    NO tables. NO line numbers. NO method names. NO bullets here.
    NO "how to fix" — that goes in the Plan section.
    MUST follow ../../../refs/feature/spec-language.md § Contexto Narrative Rules.}

   ## Acceptance Criteria

   - [ ] AC-1: Bug is no longer reproducible — Command: `{command that previously triggered the bug}`
   - [ ] AC-2: {additional verification if applicable} — Command: `{cmd}`
   ```
   Minimum 1 AC: the reproduction command for the bug (exits non-zero before fix, exits 0 after fix).
   Then **present the full spec to the user before stopping**:
   - Read the spec file just written and print its ENTIRE contents verbatim inside a fenced markdown block (```` ```markdown ... ``` ````). Do NOT summarize — the user asked to read the complete plan before approving.
   - After the fenced block, instruct: _"Run `/approve` (or `/approve --resume` to chain inline) to proceed to EXECUTE."_

- Fast Path CAN use Task(Explore) ONCE with ≤10 tool uses. Prefer Grep/Glob direct when the root cause location is known.
- If >5 files surface during DIAGNOSE, RECLASSIFY to Full Path and write a spec before proceeding.

#### Spec Boundaries

When writing a Full Path spec (or noting files for Fast Path), record which files are in scope under a `## Boundaries` section:

```
## Boundaries
- `path/to/directory/` — directory scope (all files within)
- `path/to/file.ext` — exact file
- `**/*.controller.ts` — glob pattern
```

Rules:
- List only files the fix **intentionally** touches (root cause + direct dependants)
- For Fast Path: boundaries are implicit from the ANALYZE output — no spec section required
- Out-of-boundary edits during EXECUTE will surface a `[BOUNDARY WARNING]` from guard-verify — re-evaluate scope before proceeding

### EXECUTE (fix + validate)

Every agent prompt dispatched in Fast Path MUST include:
`Return format cap: ≤50 lines. Apply compact Return Format from .claude/pipeline-config.md strictly.`

Dispatch bugfix agent with:
- Root cause from ANALYZE
- `{subproject}/CLAUDE.md` + `{subproject}/.claude/commands/guards.md` for context
- `{recommended_skills}` starting with `karpathy-guidelines, diagnose` (bugfix edits code; `diagnose` provides the disciplined diagnosis loop for fix agents) — see `.claude/refs/agent-prompt/agent-prompt.md § How to fill {recommended_skills}`
- Specific files to modify
- Expected behavior after fix
- **If role=ui** (frontend, mobile-web): append `Read templates/refs/bugfix/browser-debug.md before instrumenting — Playwright MCP + Chrome DevTools MCP playbook (reproduce → isolate → instrument → fix → prevent).` to `{context_extras}`. Stack-agnostic; loaded on demand only for UI bugs.

**Validate:**
- Build check: `dotnet build` / `pnpm typecheck` (as applicable)
- Verify fix resolves the reported issue
- No regression in adjacent code
- If build fails: diagnose + fix (max 3 iterations)

#### Escalation Status Handling

After the bugfix agent returns, check for an escalation status before closing:

- `CONCERN` — record verbatim in the bugfix report under `## Concerns`; continue to CLOSE
- `BLOCKED` — stop immediately; use `AskUserQuestion` to report the exact blocker; do NOT close
- `PARTIAL` — agent fixed some but not all reported issues; resume from the last incomplete fix step (max 2 retries)
- `DEFERRED` — agent intentionally left a related issue unfixed with justification; confirm with user before closing

See `.claude/pipeline-config.md` Escalation Statuses for the full status table.

#### Retry Compact Advisory
If an agent fails and requires >2 retry attempts during EXECUTE:
- Suggest to user: _"Multiple retries detected — stale context may be contributing. Consider `/compact` to clear context, then `/resume` to continue the pipeline."_
- This is advisory only — continue fixing if user declines.

#### Failure Routing (Bugfix)

Before retrying a failed fix attempt, classify the failure:

1. **Transient?** — Would re-running succeed without any change? (flaky test, cache, env) → Retry once immediately.
2. **Resolvable?** — Is the fix clear and patchable in ≤3 lines without new reads? → Apply patch, retry (counts as retry 1).
3. **Structural?** — Did the original ANALYZE misidentify the root cause? → **Before re-Exploring, consult the root-cause cache from Step 2b:**
   - Recompute `affectedFilesHash` for the cached `affectedFiles`.
   - **Cache hit (hash matches) AND failure signal does NOT suggest a different cause** (no keyword in the failure pointing to files outside `affectedFiles`, no REVIEW rationale explicitly naming a different root) → skip re-Explore, inject `rootCauseSummary` verbatim into the retry prompt. Log: `root-cause cached (retry {N}/2), skipping diagnose`.
   - **Cache miss (files changed) OR failure rationale points elsewhere** → invalidate cache, run targeted Explore on the actual failure point, update root cause (including new cache entry via Step 2b), re-dispatch bugfix agent.
   - Re-ANALYZE (with or without cache) does NOT count against the 2-retry cap.

Max 2 retries for Transient + Resolvable. Structural failures trigger a targeted re-ANALYZE (cache-gated), not a blind retry.

**Cache invalidation signals:**
- Affected files changed on disk → hash mismatch invalidates
- Review/build failure rationale mentions files outside `affectedFiles` → invalidate
- User explicitly overrides (rare) → invalidate
- After 2 retries exhausted, the cache is naturally flushed when the pipeline aborts or advances

### QA Phase (Wave 10)

After EXECUTE (fix + validate) completes:

1. Emit phase transition to QA:
   ```bash
   mustard-rt run emit-phase --spec {specName} --to QA
   ```
2. Run: `mustard-rt run qa-run --spec {specName}` (Full Path only — emits `qa.result` event automatically)
   - For Fast Path: manually verify the bug reproduction command exits 0, emit result to harness
3. If `overall=pass`: proceed to CLOSE
4. If `overall=fail`: the bug reproduction AC still fails — return to EXECUTE for targeted fix, max 3 QA iterations
5. Maximum 3 QA iterations — after that, escalate to user

### CLOSE

- `mustard-rt run sync-registry` (if entities changed)
- Output bugfix report (diagnosis, fix, validation, QA result)

## Zero Context-Switch Protocol

- NEVER ask "can you show the error?" — find it via logs/Grep
- NEVER ask "which file?" — trace from the error
- NEVER ask "how to fix?" — propose + implement
- CI test fails: read → fix → re-run — without reporting and waiting
- MANDATORY: Follow Visual Output, Pipeline State, Task Tracking rules at each phase
